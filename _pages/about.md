I’m a graphics and engine programmer with experience in Unreal Engine 4/5 and custom DirectX12 renderers.
I’ve worked on AAA titles like The First Descendant for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, focusing on performance optimization and engine features.
I enjoy building rendering systems, experimenting with modern graphics techniques, and tackling challenging optimization problems.
I’m currently developing Cubi Engine, a personal project for exploring the latest graphics technologies.
